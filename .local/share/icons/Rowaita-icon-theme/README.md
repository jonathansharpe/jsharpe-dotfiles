Rowaita is a Linux icon pack that combines simplicity and convenience. Informative mimtype icons will help you find the right file, even without having to look at the file extensions. And rounded shapes will give your environment a harmonious look. If you like standard Gnome icons and Papirus, Marwaita icons, then Rowaita icons are definitely worth your attention.

## Installation instruction:

Put `Rowaita`, `Rowaita-Default-Dark`, `Rowaita-Default-Light` in the icons folder:
**/home/.local/share/icons** or **/home/.icons** (in user mode) or **/usr/share/icons** (in root mode).

\* If the desired target folder does not exist, you can create it

Optionally, also move the necessary folders with the desired color:

## Key differences:

This fork includes some modifications and changes. Below you can see some key differences:

1) Changed the design of some icons to better match the overall style.

2) Changed the shape and design of folders. They are now rounded and have bold symbols on the folder icon. As for me, now they are perfectly combined with the Gnome UI. Look at this:

</p>

3) The mimetypes for the following files have been added to this icon pack. This is really cool for developers as it allows you to quickly browse files by type. For example:

## Known problems and ways to solve them:
### Problem: Icons are missing or displayed incorrectly in Flatpak applications
If your Flatpak apps are missing icons or not showing up, here's what you can do:
1) Make sure that the icons are actually in the required directory. That is, they must not be placed via a symbolic link.
2) Grant permission to the directory of custom icons. This can be done globally or for the user. For example: 
```bash
# globally
sudo flatpak override --filesystem=~/.icons
# or for user
sudo flatpak --user override --filesystem=~/.icons
```
If it doesn't work, you can try this:
```bash
sudo flatpak override --system --filesystem=~/.icons
```
