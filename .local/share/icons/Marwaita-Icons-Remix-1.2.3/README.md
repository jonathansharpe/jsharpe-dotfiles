## Description :pencil:

Icon pack for linux based on Darkomarko42 awesome marwaita icons.

This is a "remix" or revival of the popular Marwaita Icon theme made by Darkomarko42 which is what I consider one of the very few icon themes that look awesome on Budgie. Unfortunately this icon theme got discontinued a long time ago.

This icon pack pretends to revive his work by mixing the current Luna Icons and Marwaita OSX icons to be as close as possible to the original work of Darkomarko42 in the current icon-remix, so, no icons from other sources will be added.

## Install

If you want to install Marwaita using the provided installation script you can
run the following:

``` sh
# To install on ~/.icons/
$ ./install.sh

# System wide install on /usr/share/icons
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

`


## Disclaimer :warning:

I only pasted the icons together and handpicked others, no special work was done here.
If you wish to support this icon theme, you can do it by supporting Darkomarko42 or the Papirus Theme Developers, they are the ones who made the real work behind this. Consider that, supporting them can encourage them to continue developing Luna and Papirus, as a result those will get backported in here so you can enjoy an updated Marwaita theme.
