# 4.0 â€” Abacaxi al Cioccolato

## Reason for Absence

I am very sorry for the long absence, mainly @gusbemacbe's. I am just a graphic designer, I am afraid of playing with `git` commands because I used to break my projects, therefore, better I left my projects in @gusbemacbe's hands. I'll explain the reason for his absence.

Due to COVID-19 pandemic, his living situation suddenly changed, and he was unable to access necessary computer equipment and account information to work on the project. He sends his apologies for the delay, and is happy to be back on top of things!

## What's New?

Since February 9, with contributon of @Bonandry's branch `beta` and @gusbemacbe's branch `gusbemacbe`, it has been 221 commits ahead:

  <img src="../immagini/4.0/screenshot5.png" alt="New folder colours">

#### kYaru++

It is a new icons theme designed to be compatible with Kvantum and Qt5ct, in reference to #32. 

#### Yaru++ Color

Based on original Yaru's colourful 16px, 24px, 32px and 48px icons, it is derived of Yaru++ but with colourful 16px, 24px, 32px and 48px icons. 

<img src="../immagini/4.0/screenshot6.png" alt="Example of colourful 16px icons">

#### Yaru++ Minimal

In reference to #48, derived of Yaru++ Color and Yaru++, it is a minimal icons theme with only third-party icons and excluding the icons that already exist in the original Yaru icons themes. It inherits from the original Yaru icons theme. It does not include the folder colors. It has just 11.5MB, while the full Yaru++ has 71.2MB.

#### Yaru++ Smooth

Derived of Yaru++, but 24px icons are symlinked to 16px, and 32px and 48px icons are symlinked to scalable icons, so they are free of sharpness, in reference to #35.
